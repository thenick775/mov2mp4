# mov2mp4
A short bash script that converts mov to mp4, radically reducing file size with slightly lower quality

This utility was created to minimize giant mov files from the recent wave of remote education.

As storing and moving these files became cumbersome, I created this script to process files
sequentially in batch. This script is designed to reduce mov size while keeping memory and 
cpu usage of ffmpeg low.

-Requires ffmpeg: can be installed with brew install ffmpeg
